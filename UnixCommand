find . -type f -exec dos2unix {} \;

find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 dos2unix   				## Wouldn't break if you had spaces in file names.

find . -type f -name "*.php" -print0 | xargs -0 dos2unix  	##Convert only *.php files

find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 -P 4 dos2unix  		##If it's a large directory you may want to consider running with multiple processors:

This will pass 1 file at a time, and use 4 processors.
